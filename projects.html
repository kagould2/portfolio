        A student film project featured by UW–Madison's Digital Studies Certificate program.
        It was created by myself, Dawson Chen, and Prasithan Ganeshkumar.
        Made from the perspective of an alumn reminiscing about their time at university, it features still shots and dream-like filters to evoke a sense of nostalgia.

      <p>
        A YouTube Shorts series showcasing lesser-known endangered animals, what makes them unique, 
        and how they're threatened. This personal project comes from a place of passion as animals, and moreover the environment itself, are exceedingly important to me.
        There isn't much I can do as an individual, so raising awareness is something I can do to help.
